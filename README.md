Using Python, I wanted to see how the top 200 songs changed week-by-week over a period of 4 weeks. 

- Data is from Pandora

This project shows my data cleaning and transformation in Python in order to join the 4 files together and give us a visual of how each song's ranking changed week-over-week during a span of 4 weeks.

In this project, I conducted data cleaning methods, concatenating 4 separate files together, and pivoting the data to see the ranking-change results by song on a week-by-week basis.
