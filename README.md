Using Python, I wanted to see how the top 200 songs changed week-by-week over a period of 4 weeks. 

- Data is from Pandora

This project shows my data cleaning and transformation in Python in order to join the 4 files together and give us a visual of how each song's ranking changed week-over-week during a span of 4 weeks.

In this project, I:
- Imported 4 csv files from Pandora, added columns to them, then concatenated them together for further analysis
- Checked the data for any anomalies (i.e., making sure a song wasn't in the top 200 songs more than 4 times)
- Changed columns to correct datatypes
- Checked for null values
- Created a pivot table to show us the results we are looking for
- Exported the dataframe to a CSV
